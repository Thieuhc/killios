# README

All commands have been disabled for your safety. Instead of actually corrupting your device's NVRAM, this package outputs the destructive command to dpkg for a split-second, and restarts your device.

# LEGAL

By installing this package, you claim full responsibility for any damages done.

I will not be liable for any unintended side-effects beyond this point. You're on your own.
